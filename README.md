# train

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.



## Usage

To run the demo with default input

    lein run

To run with args

    lein run "Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3"

To run test

    lein test
TODO:
 1) When both graph and n are big, there will be performance issues. we need a better way to take from iterating list
 2) When doing test, Clojure spec should be used to generate input-path.
